/*
Features of an Array
Here is a list of the features of an array âˆ’
An array declaration allocates sequential memory blocks.
Arrays are static. This means that an array once initialized cannot be resized.
Each memory block represents an array element.
Array elements are identified by a unique integer called as the subscript / index of the element.
Like variables, arrays too, should be declared before they are used. Use the var keyword to declare an array.
Array initialization refers to populating the array elements.
Array element values can be updated or modified but cannot be deleted
