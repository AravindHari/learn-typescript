// Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. 
// This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.
// This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2).
